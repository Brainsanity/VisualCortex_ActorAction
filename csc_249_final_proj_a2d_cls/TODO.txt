1. Understanding evaluation scores

	Benchmark:
		Precision: 23.8
		Recall: 30.5
		F1: 25.2


2. Understand the dataset:
	Since A2D dataset is too large to be trained on a single GPU, you only need to use a smaller portion of A2D.
	How to load dataset?
	What is the data structure? How to access data?

	loader/


3. Understand template code / baseline model of each task
	How to run evaluation, data loader
		network.py
		train.py
		eval_on_val.py
		cfg/
		
		utils/

		test_for_submission.py


3. Novelty of your method: 
	Note that this cannot be trivial (e.g., more training epochs, larger learning rate). Methods without good novelty will not receive good grades.
